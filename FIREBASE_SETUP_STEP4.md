# Firebase Setup - Step 4: ✅ COMPLETED

## What I Just Did:

1. ✅ **Installed Firebase package** (`npm install firebase`)
2. ✅ **Created Firebase service** (`src/services/firebaseService.ts`)
3. ✅ **Added config to .env file** (with your Firebase credentials)
4. ✅ **Updated app layout** to initialize Firebase on startup

## Your Firebase Configuration:

- **Project ID**: `simplifyapp-d15b4`
- **Database Location**: `nam5`
- **Database Mode**: Cloud Firestore (Native) ✅

## Next Steps:

Now we need to:
1. **Update Security Rules** (Step 5)
2. **Test the connection** (Step 6)
3. **Integrate with your app** (Step 7)

## Ready for Step 5?

Tell me when you're ready, and I'll guide you through updating the Security Rules so your app can read/write to Firestore.

# Firebase Setup - Step 6: Test Firebase Connection

## Step 6: Test Firebase Connection

### Instructions:

1. **Restart Your App**
   - Stop the current app (Ctrl+C in terminal if running)
   - Run: `npm start`
   - Open the app on your device/emulator

2. **Check the Console Logs**
   - Look for these messages:
     - `✅ Firebase initialized successfully`
     - `✅ Firestore database ready`
     - `📍 Database location: nam5`

3. **Test the Connection**
   - I've added a test function to your Firebase service
   - You can test it by calling it from your app
   - Or we can add a test button in Settings

### What to Look For:

**✅ Success:**
- Console shows: `✅ Firebase initialized successfully`
- Console shows: `✅ Firestore database ready`
- No error messages

**❌ If you see errors:**
- Share the error message
- We'll troubleshoot together

---

## Quick Test Option:

I can add a "Test Connection" button in your Settings screen. Would you like me to do that?

Or you can just try creating a document in your app - if it works, Firebase is connected!

## Once Testing is Complete:

Tell me:
- ✅ Firebase initialized successfully (from logs)
- ✅ Ready to integrate Firebase with your app

Then we'll move to **Step 7: Integrate Firebase with Your App**.

# Firebase Setup - Step 7: Integrate Firebase with Your App

## ✅ Step 6 Complete!

Your Firebase connection is working perfectly! 🎉

## Step 7: Integrate Firebase with Document Storage

Now we'll connect Firebase to your app so documents are saved to Firestore.

### What We'll Do:

1. Add Firebase CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2. Update documentStore to use Firebase
3. Update pdfStore to use Firebase
4. Keep local storage as fallback

### This Will Enable:

- ✅ Documents saved to Firebase Cloud
- ✅ Real-time sync across devices
- ✅ Automatic backup
- ✅ Local storage fallback if offline
